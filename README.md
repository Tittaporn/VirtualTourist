# VirtualTourist
Virtual Tourist is an iOS app from Udacity project. An app downloads and stores images from Flickr. Tha app will allow users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.

## Udacity Project
This project is about learining simple persistence, the iOS File System, and the “sandbox.” Set up the classes I need to get Core Data up and running so that I can create, save, and delete model objects. Enable user interfaces to reactively update whenever the model changes, and safely migrate user data between versions.
